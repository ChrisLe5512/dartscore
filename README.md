Welcome to my Dart Score GitHub Page!

Use this program to keep your dart game scores quickly and efficiently!

Please note that this program is compatible with any device (desktop, laptop, smartphone or tablet) that has a web browser, but that it is specifically optimized for the following Apple devices:
- iPad (2017, 2018)
- 9.7-inch iPad Pro
- iPad Air (1, 2)
- iPad (3, 4)
- iPad Mini (with Retina display, 4)

To use this program, enter at least one player, choose the starting score, and choose how many legs you would like to play to win the game. Then, click START.

There are two ways to enter your score with this program:

1. Click the dartboard on your screen to select the individual scores of your darts. They will appear in their respective boxes below the dartboard. If you enter 3 darts, a big DONE button will appear on the dartboard. Click it to confirm your score and go to the next player. You can also use the DONE button in the top right corner of the dartboard area to do the same thing at any time, even if you don't get all 3 of your darts on the dartboard. If you accidentally tap the wrong score on the dartboard, simply tap the dart that you want to change below the dartboard and select the dart's proper score. You can assign a score of 0 to a dart by tapping on the outer ring of the dartboard (with the numbers) or anywhere in the area around the dartboard. If you enter a score higher than the one you need to finish the leg and confirm it, it will not be accepted and the program will automatically bust you.

2. You can also use the numbered buttons in the left area of your screen below the players' names and scores to punch in your score. Just like the dartboard tapping option, if you enter a score higher than the one you need to finish the leg, it will not be accepted and the program will bust you. The program will do the same thing if you enter a score higher than 180, since this is the highest score possible to get with 3 darts.

If you miss all of your darts, or if you score higher than you need to finish the leg, you can click the BUST button in the top left corner of the dartboard area to bust yourself and go to the next player right away.

Once a player's score is equal or below 180, a green box will appear below the player's name showing a suggested 3-dart or 2-dart finish, or showing 1 in the case where the player's score is 1. You can finish a leg with a single, a double, or a triple, but the suggested finishes will always end with a double, since this is the proper and only way to end a leg in a real dart game. In a real dart game, if a player's score gets down to 1, it's a bust. If you would like to play that way, you can bust yourself manually in that case.

You cannot use both scoring systems at once on the same turn. If you enter any data in either system, it will clear the other one.

When a player wins a leg, all players' scores are reset to the selected starting score and a new leg starts, with the first player in the players list scoring first. The number of legs won by a player appears above the number of legs needed to win the game, to the left of the player's name. If a player wins the amount of legs needed to win the game, of course, that player wins the game! You can then either choose to continue playing for the other players, or to end the game and start a new one.

Thank you for using my Dart Score program! Don't forget to add it to your home screen and your Reading List if you're using an Apple device to make it accessible to you anywhere, anytime, in no time!
